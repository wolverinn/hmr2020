# hmr2020

Modified HMR to be easy to use.

To start training on any Linux/Unix environment whether it's colab or a linux server, you don't even need to download this repo.

Simply run bash command ```wget https://github.com/wolverinn/hmr2020/raw/master/auto.sh && bash auto.sh``` and the training will be on !

Small checks before training:

- Python3
- Tensorflow 1.14
- Check the device for "cpu" or "gpu" in ```src/main.py``` after you run the command above.
- Check ```start.bash``` to start training !
